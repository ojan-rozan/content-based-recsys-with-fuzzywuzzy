# Content Based Filter Recommendation System With FuzzyWuzzy

## Project Introduction

<p>This project is a personal initiative aimed to develop an algorithm for a content-based product e-commerce recommendation system. The algorithm will recommend product based on the similarity of their name, category, brand, and department</p>

## Objectives
<ul>
  <li>
    Develop a content-based recommendation algorithm to suggest books similar to those a user has shown interest in.
  </li>
  <li>
    Implement text processing and feature extraction techniques to represent book content.
  </li>
  <li>
    Evaluate the algorithm's performance using similarity metrics.
  </li>
</ul>

## Dataset
The dataset I used is from an open dataset on BigQuery. Here is the link where you can access the dataset.

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
   <ul>
     <li>
       **Data Cleaning**: Checking duplicate and handling missing data
       **Delete Data**: Deleting data that not corralated with the objectivity
     </li>
   </ul>
3. Feature Engineering
4. Similarity Calculation
5. Recommendation Algorithm
